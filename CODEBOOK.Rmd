The variables in the tidy data
Tidy data contains 180 rows and 68 columns and each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.

Only all the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the tidy set were kept.

The data were averaged based on subject and activity group.
Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. Activity column has 6 types as listed below.
Rows are: 
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
